
Dear customers:

This package includes 10 JUnit test files. Each one represents one part of API. 
Before you set up your test file, make sure you include java-json.jar file and all the relative apache httpclient .jar files.
Also you need to change all the values in all the test methods with your own values, then add into formparams. For example,
		"formparams.add(new BasicNameValuePair("sob.sob_code", "www.test.com"));"


Thank you very much.
Enjoy your development.
